## C# / .NET

- [Tutorials](https://github.com/joao-neves95/Exercises_Challenges_Courses/tree/master/CSharp/Personal-Projects/Tutorials)

### Courses

1 - [Alison/Microsoft: Diploma in C# Programming (Introduction to C#)](https://github.com/joao-neves95/Exercises_Challenges_Courses/tree/master/CSharp/Diploma-in-CSharp-Programming_Alison-Microsoft)

2 - [Basics of Object Oriented Programming with C# (Udemy)](https://github.com/joao-neves95/Exercises_Challenges_Courses/tree/master/CSharp/Basics-of-Object-Oriented-Programming-with-C%23_Udemy)

  - [Extension of the final project's WebAPI with custom authentication](https://github.com/joao-neves95/Exercises_Challenges_Courses/tree/master/CSharp/Personal-Projects/Tutorials/ASPNETCore2.WebServer)
  
### WPF

 - [Braces](https://github.com/joao-neves95/Braces): An in development text editor in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and .NET Core, where the idea is that everything is a plugin. The text editor and the plugins talk in real-time through SignalR.

## C++

- [Blockchain](https://github.com/joao-neves95/Exercises_Challenges_Courses/tree/master/C%2B%2B/Blockchain): A blockchain implementation in C++, with an hybrid Proof of Work that includes Argon2d hashing (RAM instensive; maximizes resistance to GPU and ASIC's cracking attacks) and a SHA256 PoW (GPU).<br/>
```SHA256( Argon2d( blockData ) + blockData.nounce )```<br/>
To find the block's nounce**s**, the miner must do the two hashes until he reaches the desired target bits. The difficulty increments the Argon2d memory requirements.<br/>
