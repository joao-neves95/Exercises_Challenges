# How to Learn

## Modes of Thinking: Focused Learning vs. Diffuse Learning

- Focused Learning:
  - Active learning.
  - Focused.
  - Thoughts are more concentrated.
- Diffuse Learning:
  - Sometimes you can solve a problem even while taking a bath.
  - Helps with having a broader way of thinking.
  - More relaxed learning.
  - Linked to the brain's resting states.
  - Access this mode of thinking by, for example, going for a walk, exercising, taking a shower, or even when going to sleep.
  - When stuck on a problem, it is a good idea to use a more diffuse thinking.

## Techniques:

### Tackling Procrastination:

- For people who procrastinate, the easiest way of combating it is through the Pomodoro technique.
- The Pomodoro technique can also be used to avoid burnout.

### Practice and Repetition:

- The brain can easily forget some complex and abstract topics, so it's important to use practice and repetition, as it takes time to hold those memories.
- It is best to use spaced repetition, as it combats over-learning, burnout, and helps the brain adapt and assimilate the topics and turn them into memories more effectively.
- Don't practice by repeating the topic you are trying to learn many times in a single day, as this does not help long-term memory connections to form.
- Similarly, you can not build muscle in one day of repetition.
- Practice leads to beginning to thinking more independently.

### Sleeping:

- Sleeping is very important when learning.

- The brain washes away toxins developed during the day while sleeping.

- It helps assimilate and harden memories.

- You can't function well without a good night of sleep.

- Physical exercise is also proven to improve memory, energy and overall ability to learn.


### Chunking

- Smaller pieces of information that are bound together forming meaning.
- A network of neurons that synthesizes key ideas or actions.
- Single, easy to access items.
- Linked to focused attention.
- Go one small step at a time.

### Context and Chunks

- When starting to learn a certain topic, you should start by learning the more general context behind it and only after start to chunk.
- This helps having an idea of the overall area, and to know when and how to use a certain chunk of information.

### Recall

- Trying to remember the key points on a subject, without looking at the answers.
- Proven to be one of the best ways of helping the chunking process and overall learning.

### Transfer

- The idea that a chunk mastered in one area, can help to learn different chunks in other areas.
- The connectivity between different chunks of information.

### Illusions of competence in learning

- Test yourself (recall can also be used here).
- Mistakes are good. Learn from them.
- Use deliberate practice what you find more difficult.

### Einslellung

- Bias.
- Preconceived idea/thought/neural pathway you already had in mind, prevents a better idea or solution from being found.

## Procrastination

1. You are doing something that you don´t like. The pain centers in your brain light up.
2. You search for (focus your attention) doing things that makes you feel better, more enjoyable.
3. You procrastinate.

- Procrastination is linked (shares similarities) with addiction. Every time your brain feels that pain again, you try to search for temporary relief/excitement. You will also start to fool/lie and give excuses to yourself, for reasons to not study/learn/work.
- It's all about habits.
- Habits have 4 parts:
  1. The cue (the trigger);
  2. The routine (the procrastination activity);
  3. The reward;
  4. The belief (bias; preconceived idea).

### Process vs. Product

- Process
  - Relates to habits.
  - Habits that lead to the completion of the task that needs to be done.
  - Focus on the moment, not on the outcome.
  - Combine process and the Pomodoro technique.
- Product
  - An/the outcome.
  - Specific task.
  - The product is usually what triggers the pain (cue) that causes you to procrastinate.

### Planning

- Have a weekly list of key tasks.
- Plan a daily TODO list for the next day, before going to sleep or at the evening before.

## Memory

- Long term memory takes some time to form.

  Therefore, in order to move a memory from short term memory to LTM (on the cortex; process that is known as memory consolidation), it is necessary repetition for an extended time, in multiple days, for a longer period of time.

  Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.

- It would be better for memory to study 10 minutes each week for one month, than 1 hour in one day. The brain would have consolidated the subjects better.

### Tricks to Memorise

*(memory tricks helps creating a memory muscle and creativity)*

These are just some. You should try different and new tricks and see what works best for you.

- Relate concepts with visually mental images. The funnier, vivid, real the better.
- Build phrases where the first letter of every word is a word you are trying to memorise.
- Recall.
- Memory palace technique: use a space (your house, for example) that is familiar as a mental visual notepad. Attribute a concept/word/subject to a room or object. Creates neural hooks.
- Mind mapping.
