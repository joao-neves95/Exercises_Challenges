# Initialization #

To initialize the theme functionality, add the function ``` setTheme() ``` as soon as the user enters on the application (e.g. on the main.js file).



# Update #

For all the dynamic content that needs a theme update to change its color (e.g. new categories), add the function ``` updateTheme() ```.

This function will only update if necessary.
